# 3-column-preview-card-component-challenge-hub



   In this project I used mainly flexbox in order to center the content in page. Within the container, I created 3 cards, each with the same components: Image, header, paragraph and button. After that, I styled in CSS according to the guide. I used media queries to accomplish the responsive layout that was required by the challenge.
